This web site is a **toy**.

It was built to demonstrate some use cases for the
[WebCrypto API](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html).
The API is available in every major browser and provides web developers
with powerful cryptographic tools.

Leveraging these APIs correctly can be difficult and one must exercise
caution when using cryptography.

Pleas visit [wcbin.tech](https://wcbin.tech) to see it in action.
