      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This web page is a <strong>toy</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was built to demonstrate some use cases for the
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/Overview.html">WebCrypto API</a>.
        The API is available in every major browser and provides web developers
        with powerful cryptographic tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leveraging these APIs correctly can be difficult and one must exercise
        caution when using cryptography.
      </p>
      <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The Encrypt page lets you select one or more image files. After
        selecting the desired file(s), enter a passphrase and click the
        'Encrypt' button. The page should prompt a file download, allowing you
        to save an encrypted blob file (the file extension is .bin).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Decrypt page lets you select an encrypted bin file and a
        passphrase. When 'Decrypt' is clicked, the page will attempt to decrypt
        and render the images selected on the Encrypt page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The selected files are not uploaded and all the encryption and
        decryption is handled directly within the browser.
      </p>
      <h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
      <p>
        Downloads may incorrectly be reported as failed on the Chrome mobile
        browser. Additionally, you may have to carefully navigate your mobile
        file picker to find the .bin downloads on the Decrypt page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please report any other issues to
        <a href="https://github.com/mikeycgto/wcbin/issues/new">Github</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-it-words">How it works</h2>
      <p>
        If you try the Encrypt page, you'll notice it has an input for a
        passphrase. The passphrase is used as the input to a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">
          Key Derivation Function</a> called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a>. From the
        weak passphrase, PBKDF2 will iteratively use a hash function to
        accomplish something called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching">
          Key Stretching</a>. The process aims to make an otherwise weak
        passphrase stronger by increasing the computational time needed to test
        a given key. Key stretching is a process developers should already be
        familiar with when using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">
          bcrypt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">
          scrypt</a> to store passwords in a database.
      </p>
      <p>
        PBKDF2 also accepts a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a>,
        which is a piece of random data. This data is used to prevent
        dictionary lookup attacks. The Encrypt page will generate a new salt,
        16 bytes in length, every time the button is pressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        From PBKDF2 we derive a stronger key we can use for further
        cryptographic operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Encrypt page uses the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">
          AES</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">
          symmetric key algorithm</a> to encrypt the
        selected files. This algorithm is a type of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">block cipher</a>
        which can be run in many
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">
          modes of operation</a>. The WebCrypto API alone supports four
        different modes. The different modes, however, do not provide the same
        security features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Encrypt page uses the AES algorithm in a mode called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">
          Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)</a>. This mode provides a feature known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">
          Authenticated Encryption</a>. In addition to protecting the confidentiality
        of the data, this mode also protects the integrity of the data in a
        single cryptographic operation. Protecting integrity an important
        property for a modern cipher. Cryptography experts have discussed
        Authenticated Encryption in general and why it's necessary in detail
